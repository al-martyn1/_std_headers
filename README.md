This repository allows You (if it is supported by your IDE) to simply include std header file by C++ std type name.
Add "std_headers" to C++ include search path and then type:

  #include <std/
  
And then Your IDE will suggest a suitable types for You.

Git-hub does not allow you to keep more than 1000 files in one directory, so you have to generate them yourself using umba-make-headers utility.
